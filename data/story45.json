He frowned; there was absolutely no reason for it to be there. What good was an empty jar at a business which dealt strictly with numbers? He looked past his desk, down the row of cubicles occupied by the data crunchers who worked under him. Connor lives on a farm, Jake thought to himself. Maybe he\u2019ll know why this jar is sitting on my desk.\n\n\u201cConnor\u2026\u201d he began, walking over to stand behind his computer.\n\n\u201cAlmost done with the Tinasky report, boss!\u201d he said, turning around in his chair to look up at Jake. \u201cOnce that\u2019s done, I\u2019ll move on to archiving-\u201c\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing great,\u201d said Jake, cutting him off. Connor was the rare breed of High School Part-time employee who was actually excited to have a job over the summer. The work ethic was nice, but the chipper attitude was quite annoying. \u201cWhat I really wanted to know was if you knew anything about the glass jar on my desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sure,\u201d said Connor, nodding his head. \u201cMr. Flint came by and put that on your desk. He said that you were supposed to use it to collect what is due. He also said that you\u2019d know what that means,\u201d he added, noticing Jake\u2019s confused look. \u201cAnyway, I think he\u2019s still in his office.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should probably figure out what he wants, and why he thinks I need a jar for it,\u201d said Jake, rubbing his chin as he mused it over. \u201cThank you, Connor. Keep up the good work.\u201d\n\n\u201cDork,\u201d he muttered under his breath. It was bad enough being the manager of a team of \u2018Data Processing Advocates\u2019, a fancy title for a grunt job that involved converting all of their paper documents into digital reports. Everyone knew it was a shit job that was one step away from being replaced by a digital scanner, which is why most of the positions were held by surly teenagers forced to get a job by their parents. The kids would work for a month or two before quitting or getting fired, at which point they\u2019d be replaced by the next batch of surly teenagers. Years later, it would show up on their resume, and give them needed job experience so that they could get a slightly less shitty job elsewhere. It was the way of the world.\n\nBut, no. Six months and counting, Connor was still here, and just as happy and eager as he\u2019d ever been. Didn\u2019t the kid realize that he was just a cog in the machine? The only thing more offensive than his optimism was his attire. No matter how many times you told the kid that there wasn\u2019t a dress code at his salary grade, he still showed up in khakis and a tucked, collared shirt.\n\nStop it, Jake, he thought to himself, grabbing the jar and walking across the building to Lucas Flint\u2019s office. This is how you depress yourself. Not everyone gets to have their happy dream job, and there\u2019s no shame in being a manager. He\u2019ll figure out that the world sucks soon enough, and then you won\u2019t have to feel that empty spot in your soul where your dreams used to be whenever you have to talk to him.", "action_results": [{"action": "Head to Lucas's office.", "result": "\u201cYou wanted to see me, sir?\u201d said Jake, opening the door to Lucas\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cWhy, yes\u2026 yes, I did,\u201d he replied, looking up from a sheaf of papers at his desk. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to pay your debts, Mr. Cooper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 afraid I don\u2019t follow,\u201d he said, placing the jar on his desk.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s very simple, Jacob,\u201d he said, standing up from his chair. \u201cWhen I hired you as a manager here, one year ago, you promised me that you would put your soul, in its entirety, and invest it into this company, did you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026well, probably,\u201d Jake replied, rubbing the back of his neck. Where was this going?\n\n\u201cAnd yet, here we are, one year later, and your soul is still your own. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re doing a bad job, mind you\u2026 but you would be a lot more efficient if you would just hand your soul over to me. You\u2019d finally favor cold, hard logic and the rules of business over vague ideas of human decency.\n\n\u201cThere would certainly be a lot less moping,\u201d he added, picking up the jar and tracing the edge of the rim with his finger.\n\n\u201c\u2026sir?\u201d Jake began to instinctively step backwards, toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I follow the joke. You\u2019re freaking me out, here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of the modern age,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cYou all think that Science has completely explained away the Supernatural, and so you all sign away your soul, not even considering the possibility that you\u2019ve been dealing with demons. You sold your soul to me the moment I hired you as a manager- as if you had any other qualifications. And now that it\u2019s no longer practical to allow you to keep borrowing it, I intend to collect your debt.\u201d\n\nJake watched with a morbid curiosity as the mason jar flew straight at his heart, the rim of the jar passing through his clothes to sear straight into his flesh. He flinched at the sharp sensation of pain, although his limbs began to feel heavy. A stream of milky white, cloudy liquid was pouring forth in from the center of the wound, slowly filling the jar with what he could only assume was his soul. Jake raised a hand in hesitation, too afraid to pull the jar out of his chest.\n\n\u201cAny last words before I take back what is mine?\u201d asked Lucas, with a condescending chuckle.", "action_results": [{"action": "\"What if I gave you someone else's soul?\"", "result": "\"And what gives you the ability to speak for someone else's soul?\" Lucas asked, with a condescending smirk.\n\n\"Does it matter?\" Jake said, wringing his hands nervously. \"You're taking mine out of, what, a year old verbal contract? You're the demon, you figure it out. Just... bring someone on my team in here. These sort of debts transfer, don't they?\"\n\n\"I suppose they do,\" Lucas said, his smirk widening into a grin. \"I'll send a chat message to Connor. He's the most likely to respond quickly, don't you think?\" Jake merely nodded in reply; the jar in his chest was still slowly filling with liquid, and he was afraid to do anything too vigorous.\n\nJake stood there in awkward silence, waiting patiently by the door as his soul slowly poured out. Lucas had started ignoring Jake entirely, and was instead sorting papers on his desk and casually filing them away. It was Lucas's complete indifference to the whole situation which found to be the most unsettling. Finally, approaching footsteps broke the tense quiet.\n\n\"You... wanted to see me, sir?\" said Connor, nervously opening the door.\n\n\"Ahh, Mr. Wilkinson... thank you for coming...\" Lucas stood up from his seat, with a deceptively friendly smile on his face.\n\nJake had other plans. Before Lucas could finish whatever monologue he'd had prepared, Jake ripped the jar off of his body and shoved it straight into Connor's chest. \"You idiot!\" Lucas yelled, dropping the kind act and switching back to his demonic voice. \"Do you know what you've done!?\"\n\n\"No?\" Jake said, tilting his head in confusion as he stared at the jar on Connor's chest. Jake's soul had vanished; quickly absorbed into Connor's body as if it were a dry sponge. \"Why did it do that? I was just going to skip the contracts and pull out his soul like you did mine.\"\n\n\"Why is there are a jar on my chest?\" Connor asked, his voice shaking. Both of his hands were nervously resting on the jar, clearly too afraid to pull it out. \"And what happened to that white liquid?\"\n\n\"The jar only works if there's a corresponding contract,\" Lucas said, snatching the jar back in anger. \"You just gave Connor your soul, you foolish mortal! Now he has two of them, and I can't obtain either of them!\"\n\n\"I... I don't really understand what is going on here,\" Connor said, looking back and forth between the two men in confusion, \"but if it will help any, I can give him mine. I mean, I don't need two...\"\n\n\"You will?\" Lucas repeated. \"Why, that's... that's perfect!\" he said, his smile growing even larger than it had before. Lucas walked around to the front of his desk, and pressed his fingers firmly against Connor's forehead. Connor passed out, his body falling limply to the ground.\n\n\"The hell did you just do?\" Jake yelled, instinctively taking a step back in fear.\n\n\"Oh, relax,\" Lucas replied, with a sneer. \"You'll find out soon enough. Stop struggling and get it over with. This is all your fault, anyway,\" he added, tapping Jake on the forehead.", "action_results": [{"action": "Jake didn't even feel his body hit the ground.", "result": "Jake tried to open his eyes, shaking his head to try and clear the fog out of his mind with little success. His eyelids felt heavy, and his limbs felt like lead; completely unresponsive. He jerked at his arm, which flopped against a nearby desk. It was as if his body could only be controlled by puppet strings. Finally, his eyes were open enough to make out the form of Lucas, standing in front of him with a smug grin on his face.\n\n\"Oh, good, you're both finally awake,\" he said. \"I didn't want to alarm anyone, so I took the liberty of moving you both into one of the smaller conference rooms. Work ended about ten minutes ago, so I also went ahead and logged you both out. You're welcome.\"\n\nJake frowned. Lucas was far too happy, and it was making him nervous. Even before Jake knew that Lucas was some sort of demon, he had learned that Lucas was only ever truly happy if someone else was in utter misery.\n\nAs his limbs gained sensation, Jake felt an uncomfortable tightness around his neck. He instinctively unfastened the button at his collar, and then paused; today was casual Friday. He had worn a company t-shirt, like always. He looked down and saw a pair of pressed khaki slacks, and the textured weave of a collared polo shirt. His arms were no longer covered in hair, and his hands were all wrong. He jerked his head sideways, instintively knowing what he would see. There was his body, his own body of thirty years, sitting there next to him.\n\n\"It's that moment of dawning comprehension that I love the most,\" Lucas said, with a wide smile. \"Connor offered his soul to you, Jake. Not a soul, not your soul, but his soul. Of course, that meant you two had to switch bodies, but... well, I'm sure you'll both work it out. Call me if you need anything,\" he said, cackling to himself as he left the room.\n\n\"So... this is really happening, isn't it,\" Connor said, wringing his hands nervously.\n\n\"Yes. Yes it is,\" Jake replied, taking deep breaths. \"Lucas is some sort of demon. He tried to take my soul, failed, and now we've ended up in each other's bodies,\" Jake explained, omitting the part where this whole mess was his fault for trying make a deal. \"I vote we head back to my apartment to try and sort this whole mess out.\"\n\n\"Wait, no, we can't,\" Connor said, standing upright in a panic. \"My parents would freak! I mean, this is their date night, so Zoe, Tyler and I are on our own anyway, but... they at least need to know where I am!\"\n\nJake rolled his eyes. \"We are not splitting up. I don't want you alone in my apartment, and you sure as hell aren't going to leave me alone with your family.\"\n\n\"Okay...\" Connor said, biting his lip in thought. \"What if we say that your apartment... some pipes broke so, you have no water and I offered the couch to you since you have nowhere else to go?\"\n\nJake groaned. \"Did I just step in a steaming pile of sit-com plot cliches? We may as well just pretend you're coming with me on a business conference as a last minute replacement. At least that way I don't have to try and act like you around your family.\"", "action_results": [{"action": "\"Fine. We'll do it your way, and spend the night at your place.\"", "result": "By the time Jake and Connor made it to Connor's house, his parents had already left the building. Zoe and Tyler had already eaten, leaving the two of them to scrounge for food in the kitchen. Connor cooked himself a full spaghetti dinner, boiling the pasta and cooking some hamburger from the fridge. Jake, on the other hand, was content to microwave some frozen chicken strips.\n\nTyler was up in his room, but Zoe was still downstairs in the living room. She was watching cartoons in front of the TV, with her stuffed bear in her lap.\n\n\"I supppose this means channel 67 is out of the question,\" Jake said with a sigh.\n\n\"Do you think she'll let us watch something else if we ask?\" Connor asked, emphasizing his speech with his eyebrows to gesture that it wasn't actually a question.\n\n\"Hmmph. Hey, Zoe,\" Jake asked, walking over to crouch down next to her, \"Do you think Co- ahh, Jake and I could watch something else on the TV when you're done with this show?\"\n\n\"Sure thing Mr. Connor's Boss!\" she said, without looking away. Connor and Jake exchanged frantic looks with each other, while Zoe simply sat there, giving her bear an occasional hug.\n\n\"Ummm... Zoe... that's my boss,\" Jake said, pointing at Connor, who was still standing in the kitchen. \"I'm your brother. You know that.\"\n\n\"Nuh-uh!\" she said, standing up to walk into the kitchen. \"Connor always cooks a real dinner, and he always smiles when he walks around the house. So you must be Connor,\" she said pointing at the real Connor. \"You may have switched bodies, but you can't fool me!\"\n\nJake glanced between Connor and Zoe. He was standing there dumbfounded, with his mouth slightly open; she was returning his confusing with a wide smile, as she rocked back and forth in a swaying motion, hugging her bear.\n\n\"Umm, Zoe, about that...\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Tell Zoe the truth.", "result": "\"You're completely right, Zoe,\" Jake said, patting her on the head. \"Your brother and I have switched bodies. Magic is real.\"\n\n\"I knew it!\" she said, giving her toy a fierce hug, and scampering away.\n\n\"...was that really a good idea?\" Connor asked.\n\n\"No idea,\" Jake said, shrugging his shoulders. \"But I didn't want to try and convince her otherwise. Especially since she's right. And, well, if this causing any long-term trauma down the line, I won't have to be around for it.\"\n\n\"Thanks for that,\" Connor said, rolling his eyes. \"So, now what?\"\n\n\"Now you ruin everything, that's what,\" said a voice from the back door. Jake and Connor turned around to find Lucas, standing in the kitchen doorway.\n\n\"How did you...\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Lucas spat. \"I'm a supernatural being, I go wherever I damn well want to go. Granted, I normally try and maintain an aloof, sinister aura by using a lot of flashy magic, but... oh, fuck it. The point is, you told Zoe that you were in each other's bodies, and she actually believed you. You've complicated the contract, and now it's no longer worth the expended magical effort to collect either of your souls.\"\n\n\"Does that mean you'll switch us back?\" Connor asked, hesitantly.\n\n\"It does,\" Lucas said, snapping his fingers. There was a blurry rush of vision, and Jake suddenly found himself standing on the opposite side of the room, staring at Connor's body. Jake felt relief wash over his body as he quickly examined his hands- they were his own.\n\n\"Of course, it also means that there absolutely no reason not to endeavor to make your like a living Hell,\" Lucas said, staring straight into Jake's eyes. \"I consider this to be your fault. You agreed to the contract. You agreed to the deal. And somehow, you managed to luck your way out of it all. Consider your days numbered, Jacob Cooper. You have made a mortal enemy out of the demons of Hell.\" With that, Lucas disappeared in a puff of foul-smelling smoke.\n\nJake stood there in silence, trying to process what Lucas had just said. It was Connor who finally broke the tension in the room.\n\n\"Well... at least you've got your body back?\"", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Lie to Zoe.", "result": "\"Look, Zoe, I just had a long day, okay? I'm tired, and a bit cranky, and I just don't feel up to cooking right now, okay?

Jake and Connor spun around to find Lucas standing in the kitchen, a faint trace of foul-smelling smoke disappating at his feet.\n\n\"Oh, God, what now?\" Jake asked, as Connor began to unconsciously step back away from Lucas.\n\n\"You offend me,\" Lucas said, grasping his chest in mock horror. \"Connor voiced a preference for having a world without magic, and I thought I'd take him up on that offer.\"\n\n\"We're in each other's bodies, and you're some sort of demon who wants our souls. How would that work, exactly?\" Jake said, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"Well, obviously I wouldn't get rid of all magic,\" Lucas explained, spreading his hands. \"But I would dispel everything which has affected you over the past few hours.\"\n\n\"Deal!\" Connor yelled, extending his hand.\n\n\"You idiot!\" Jake said, turning to yell at him. \"Why would you accept?\"\n\n\"Because I don't want to be in your body anymore!\" Connor yelled. \"I just want this whole mess to be over with!\"\n\n\"So it is done,\" Lucas said, snapping his fingers. Connor collapsed to the ground, unconscious. \"Of course, that also dispelled the magic I used to put Connor's soul into that body. And without any place for it to go, I now own it. But you probably guessed that,\" Lucas said, with a chuckle.\n\n\"Of course I did,\" Jake said, examining the husk of his former body on the ground. \"It had trap written all over it. But you have Connnor's soul now, right? So will you put me back?\"\n\n\"Why, I don't believe that was ever a part of the bargain...\" Lucas said, with a grin on his face. \"That means you're Connor Wilkinson now. Congratulations on your new life. Shame your current boss randomly succombed to a deep coma.\"\n\nJake narrowed his eyes. \"Alright, you bastard. You win. How do I get my life back?\"\n\n\"You don't,\" Lucas said, spreading his arms. \"But if you like, I can spare you the misery of trying to live out Connor's life. I don't think you'd last very long as a puritanical teenager, after all.\"\n\nJake sighed. \"Fine. You win. Take my soul.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" Lucas said, his smirk widening into an evil grin. Jake could feel Lucas's fingers press against his forehead. He was unconscious before he hit the ground.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "\"We're doing it my way. A quick stop at your parents and then over to my place.\"", "result": "\"I don't know about this...\" Connor said, visibly pouting as he drove them both to his house.\n\n\"You're just upset because it's not your idea,\" Jake said, waiving his hand dismissively. \"A last minute business trip makes just as much sense as me staying over at your place because of apartment issues. As if I would have to resort to staying with one of my employees over local family. Or a hotel. Or yelling at the office staff until they found me accommodations elsewhere. Besides, I already called them and told them about it. They were ecstatic that the company was giving you this opportunity. We have to go through with it, now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Connor said, with a sigh. \"Anyway, we're here. My room's at the top of the stairs, on the left. Suitcase is under the bed. I'll wait here?\"\n\n\"Sounds fine,\" Jake said, shrugging his shoulders. He walked in, and rushed straight up to Connor's room without bothering to find Tyler or Zoe. The less he could interact with Connor's family, the better.\n\nConnor's room was about what he expected- spotless floor, a clean bed, and no laundry to be seen spilling from the closet or the dresser drawers. The walls were decorated with a few sports posters, but apart from that it was a very boring, sterile room. Figures.\n\nThere was an awkward stuffed bear sitting on the bed, though. Jake didn't recognize it from any cartoon, so it was probably some off-brand toy. Jake swept it onto the floor. \"Sharing is caring!\" it croaked. \"You have to put in effort to get good things back!\"\n\n\"Of course it's a talking toy,\" Jake muttered to himself. \"God forbid there be a children's toy that doesn't require batteries these days.\" He pulled the suitcase out from under the bed, and started filling it with clothes. After rummaging through several drawers, Jake was finally able to locate a few souvenir t-shirts he could wear instead of Connor's wardrobe. No such luck with underwear, though- it seemed Connor only wore briefs.\n\nAfter finding enough clothes for the weekend, Jake threw in the stick of deodorant from the nightstand, and called it good enough.\n\n\"Has Beary said goodbye to you?\" asked a shrill voice from downstairs.\n\n\"Yes, yes he did,\" Jake yelled, scooping up the bear from where it had fallen on the floor. Jake zipped up the suitcase, and dragged it down the stairs. \"Here he is back, ahh... Zoe,\" he said, handing it back to her. She replied with a giggle, giving the bear a fierce hug. \"Bye Zoe, bye Tyler,\" he said, nodding in their general direction as he walked out the door.

He turned around to find Connor still standing there. \"I know I gave you back your keys so that you could drive your car... but the keys to my apartment are in your pocket, you know,\" Jake said, with an exaggerated sigh.\n\n\"Oh, right,\" he said, blushing profusely as he entered the apartment.\n\n\"I knew we should have taken my car,\" Jake muttered. \"Whelp, my place is your place,\" he said, throwing the suitcase in the corner and flinging open the refrigerator doors. \"This is the kitchen and that's the living room slash bedroom, obviously,\" he said, pointing toward the back wall of the studio apartment. \"I still get my bed, so you're getting the couch tonight. Bathroom's around the corner. Make yourself at home.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Connor asked, watching in horror as Jake pulled the stopper off of a bottle of scotch with his teeth.\n\n\"What? I'm getting a drink.\"\n\n\"I'm not 21 yet!\" Connor said, his face recoiling in disgust.\n\n\"Ask me if I care,\" he muttered. \"The soul is legal, so the body can go and suck it. I want a stiff drink, and I'll be damned if something as absurd as body switching is going to get in my way. You're over 18 though, right?\"\n\n\"...yes,\" Connor answered, eying him nervously.\n\n\"Good,\" Jake replied, gesturing with the glass he had just poured. \"Because I'm also going to be watching porn tonight.\"\n\n\"My body is a temple!\" Connor yelled, visibly shaking with rage.\n\n\"No, your body was a temple. Then I got inside of it, and now it's a convenience store. You'll live.\"\n\n\"I cannot believe you,\" he said, clenching his fists. \"I would do anything to end this whole mess right now!\"\n\nConnor's sudden rage was cut short by a flash of sulphur and red smoke from the front door. \"I believe that's my cue,\" Lucas said, walking in through the brimstone. He was carrying the mason jar in both hands. \"Well, then, gentlemen, what will it be?\"\n\nJake paused. The way Lucas was carrying that jar... it reminded him of a little kid clutching a toy.

That's an open and close case in my book.\"\n\n\"But that's... you... I don't... Jake, tell me he's kidding. Is that really what this whole mess is about? You're in league with him just to get my soul.\"\n\n\"Well, kinda,\" Jake replied, scratching the back of his neck.\n\n\"I'm actually taking your soul instead of his,\" Lucas said with a smile. He walked over to Connor and shoved the jar into his chest. \"He struck a last minute deal, and I accepted.\"\n\n\"You damned me to Hell just to save your own soul!?\" Connor yelled.\n\nJake shrugged his shoulders. \"Welcome to the real world, kid,\" he said, avoiding eye contact.\n\n\"That's your reply? The world is corrupt so that's your excuse to be corrupt too? I cannot believe you! How can you possibly be this horrible of a person!?\" Connor probably would have continued his tirade, but Lucas knocked him unconscious.\n\n\"That's enough of that,\" Lucas said, dusting off his hands. He pulled the jar away, and sealed it with the lid. \"As agreed, I'll restore your body.\" Once again, Jake passed out the moment Lucas touched his forehead.\n\nWhen he awoke, he found himself sitting on the living room sofa, with his glass of scotch in his hands.

The world went black, and just as quickly snapped back into focus. \"Was... was that it?\" Jake asked, patting his chest where the jar had been.\n\n\"That was it,\" Lucas replied. \"It may feel like only a slight lapse of consciousness for you, but it's actually been over an hour. I've weighed out the purity of your soul, and it came out at 23 feather units. Which, given that you're not familiar with the purity system... anything above 20 makes for a decent person, so I'm impressed. Heaven isn't guaranteed until 30 units, but at least you're above 10.\"\n\n\"So... I don't feel any different at all,\" Jake said, examining his arms. \"Should I... be feeling something? Do I have any powers? How will I know which soul is good enough?\"\n\n\"You won't know a soul's worth until after it's already been signed away,\" Lucas said, with a shrug. \"But you've been their manager for a few weeks; you should have a rough idea of who is better than who. Although, I warn you, teenagers generally don't rate highly, as they haven't been out on their own to face temptation. Purity is nothing without a foil of perversion. As far as your powers go... as a low ranking repo-demon, you don't have any. But you can make offers. Get them to sign a contract on the cursed parchment, and then the terms will come to pass. The parchment has no limit, but try to sign away material things first- that sort of thing can come out of your paycheck. The purity of their soul, minus the cost of the wish needed to obtain the soul, will show up in the corner of the page so that you'll know how many souls you need to collect. Do whatever you need to do, but try not to blow your cover, hmm?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Parchment in hand, Jake went back to his desk.", "result": "Jake looked at the people in his squad, trying to weigh the pros and cons of each. Connor was his first thought; the kid was likely to have purity through the roof. But on the other hand, he was also deeply religious, and there was no way he'd be able to get him to sign over his soul. He looked down the line of desks, and realized he simply didn't know enough about most of them in order to tempt them.\n\nAlice was probably a safe bet. Shy, homely girls being tempted by the promise of beauty was practically a sure bet. Although, depending on how much magic would be needed to make her beautiful, that might not give him much room for profit...\n\nPerhaps Tanner? The kid had a noticeable belly, and Jake had been noticing him bringing in HealthyFit trail mix to work instead of the potato chips that normally composed his mid-day snacks. Maybe a quick fix solution to get fit would be worth his soul?\n\nAnd then there was Kevin. Based on the state of clothes and his car, and the way he was constantly complaining about his bills, he could probably be tempted easily with money. He wasn't a good person in any sense of the word, but Lucas made it sound like gifts of money could be done for virtually no cost.\n\nJake shook his head. All of them seemed like long shots. Who would willingly sign away their soul? But then again, Jake was reminded of what Lucas had told him. In this day and age... who still takes that sort of thing seriously? Connor was the only religious person he had working for him- all the rest were surly teenagers still trying to find their place in the world. Jake shrugged. What did he have to lose? May as well pull one of them aside, and see if they'd take the bait.", "action_results": [{"action": "Start with Alice.", "result": "\"Alice, you could stop by my desk when you have a moment?\" Jake said, calling out over the row of cubicles.\n\n\"Is... is something wrong?\" she stuttered, approaching his desk a few minutes later. \"Is this about my productivity scores, or...?\"\n\n\"No, no, nothing like that,\" Jake said, with a friendly smile and a dismissive wave. \"You're not in trouble. Think of this as... an offer. Or an opportunity, if you will. There's no easy way for me to ask this, but... how would you like to be beautiful?\"\n\n\"Sir...?\"\n\n\"I know, I know, but hear me out.

Jake, what does that even mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't sweat it,\" Jake said, lying through his teeth. \"I signed one of these too. The idea is that you pour your heart and soul into the company. The specifics to be determined later, of course, but mostly we're just looking for a long term promise from you.\"\n\n\"Well, that's...\" Alice paused, looking at it nervously. \"And if I leave the company, I can pay that back in a different way?\"\n\n\"Of course you can,\" Jake said, with a warm smile. \"I understand you're just in high school right now, with no idea of where you're going to go in the world. Don't work about it. We can work out something else if need be.\"\n\n\"Then... then I'll do it,\" she said, taking a deep breath as she signed the contract. Alice gasped in shock as her body slowly adjusted itself. Her freckles vanished, her breasts expanded, and her modest clothing adjusted itself to better frame her now impressive figure. She wandered back to her desk in shock, letting the changes to her body sink in.\n\n\"And probably also the feeling of no longer having a soul,\" Jake said to himself. He took a look at the contract.

I'll just fill this one out like so... and I can guarantee you muscles.\"\n\n\"I... what?\" Tanner said, shaking his head in confusion. \"Did you just say muscles?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Jake said, offering him the contract with a smile. \"I can offer you muscular arms, fit legs, and a chest with ripped abs, instead of the beer belly you've currently got.\"\n\n\"How is that even possible?

Tanner's soul was ranked at 25 purity, minus 15 for the cost of sculpting his body, for a net profit of 10 feathers. \"Well, crap,\" Jake muttered.\n\nCombined with Kevin's contract, he was up to 17 feathers- still a fair ways to go. \"Dammit. I was hoping to be done by now, but if I can get Alice's soul for a good price, I'll...\"\n\n\"...fall a bit short, I believe you were about to say.\" Jake looked up to find Lucas standing over him. \"You're out of time. Follow me, please.\"", "action_results": [null]}, {"action": "\"And... well, actually, you're next.\"", "result": "\"And... well, actually, you're next,\" Jake said, deciding to try and see if he could tempt Nate. \"Go ahead and come over here- I hate talking through cubical walls, and anyway, I'll need you to sign something.\" Not knowing where to begin, Jake just created another contract like Kevin's- $5,000 in easy money.\n\n\"Well, I don't know how much you overheard, but Lucas- that's Mr. Flint, he gave me this stack of contracts here. Think of them as a sort of employee appreciation bonus. All you need to do is sign here, and the money is yours.\"\n\n\"And... just what am I agreeing to sign, exactly?\" Nate asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n\"Well, basically it's a statement saying that you're going to invest your entire heart and soul into the company,\" Jake said, his spirits sinking. Nate had caught onto the gimmick rather quickly. Perhaps this had been a bad idea? \"It's... it's a loyalty thing,\" Jake said, scratching the back of his neck.\n\n\"I... guess,\" Nate said, grabbing the contract and looking it over. \"But what it actually says is that I'm forfeiting my soul. You... realize that, right? I mean, I don't care, but I would imagine that a lot of people here would. Christ, can you imagine how someone like Connor would react to a statement like that?\"\n\n\"That's... a good point,\" Jake said, with a laugh. Apparently Nate also didn't believe in the supernatural, which was going to make things a lot easier. \"I'm actually surprised that you don't care, though, honestly. I can't believe such a bone-headed error made it onto the contract. We'll have to throw these others out. But... did you want to sign one of these, or wait for a corrected one? I can't give you anything until we've got your signature.\"\n\n\"Eh, I'll just sign this one,\" Nate said, picking up a nearby pen. \"The mistake doesn't bother me. I'm an athiest. I don't believe in souls.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you should,\" Jake replied with a smirk. He looked at the contract- 20 feathers, minus one for the money... success! \"If you'll excuse me, I need to meet with Lucas before the end of the day.\"\n\n\"Did... did that money just appear out of nowhere?\" Nate asked, nervously staring at the pile of cash which had appeared the moment he had signed the contract. \"You... you were kidding, right? I mean, souls don't exist. The idea is utterly ridiculous. And if they did, it wouldn't be that easy for me to sign mine away, right? Right?\"", "action_results": [{"action": "Jake didn't bother with a reply.", "result": "Lucas looked up from his desk as Jake strolled proudly inside. \"Ahh... Jake, I was just about to come and find you. How did you fare?\"\n\n\"Between Kevin and Nate, I've got 26 feathers of purity. Or however you measure that crap. The point is, I got more than the 23 that I needed, so I get my soul back.\"\n\n\"So you did,\" Lucas said, with a smile. \"I have to admit, I'm quite surprised. But, a deal is a deal. Your soul is now your own once more. Of course, there is the slight complication of your employment as a repo-demon...\"\n\nJake could feel the enthusiasm and hope draining from his body.\n\n\"You see, Jake... repo-demons are not mortal, and therefore do not have souls. So, even though you now own your soul in a jar, you can't really do anything with it. Restoring you to your mortality was never a part of the deal. And since I know you're going to ask... no, you cannot simply stop being a repo-demon.\n\n\"You now have two options available to you. One, you continue to serve me as a repo-demon, collecting souls and earning the privledge of continued existance. Why, in a few eons, you might even get a promotion! Or, you could try and defy me. Then I decide that I no longer need your services, and you simply cease to exist.\"\n\nJake looked frantically back and forth between Lucas and his soul. \"But... you never... I didn't.... that's not...\"\n\n\"Is that not fair?\" Lucas taunted, finishing Jake's words. \"Since when was Hell ever known for being fair? I was more than willing to give you that information. You just never asked. In fact, the whole situation is rather like what you just did to Nate back there, is it not? Using omission of the truth against him, to get what you want? Only in my case, I'm just twisting the knife further into the wound of the already damned. You, however, just damned an otherwise completely innocent teenager to the fires of Hell. Given what you've just done to Nate and Kevin, I can't imagine why you would even want your mortality back. As if you could ever be forgiven. You may as throw your lot in with us, Jake. We're all you deserve.\"\n\n\"I...\" Jake let out a deep sigh. Lucas had won. Better to give in now, than to try and make some further bargain and ruin things further. \"I exist to serve,\" he said, kneeling down before him.", "action_results": []}]}]}]}]}, {"action": "Say nothing.", "result": "\"Suit yourself,\" Lucas said, with a shrug. \"If you think I'm going to be impressed by your stoic silence, you are sadly mistaken.\n\n\"Honestly, I was hoping you would plead for your soul. It makes my job so much more enjoyable. Not to mention you idiot mortals usually give me all sorts of contractual loop holes I can exploit to obtain even more souls... but, no matter. You'll be a soulless husk soon enough, and I can certainly use that to my advantage. A second puppet to use in my schemes will be very helpful here... why, with enough planning, I might even be able to obtain Connor's soul!\n\n\"But I digress,\" he said, cutting his monologue short. \"It's not like any of this is relevant to you. Your brief span of life on this planet is about to end.\" Jake felt a shortness of breath and a sinking, hollow feeling in his stomach when Lucas pulled the jar away.\n\n\"Say goodbye to your last moments of consciousness, Jacob,\" he said, his grin growing ever wider. Lucas pressed his fingers against Jake's forehead, and he felt his body go completely limp out from under him. The world had faded to black before he had even hit the ground.", "action_results": []}]}]}
